        <p>
            If anyone on the verge of action should judge himself according to the outcome,
            he should never begin. Even though the result may gladden the whole world,
            that cannot help the hero; for he only knows the result when the whole thing is 
            over, and that is not how he became a hero, but by virtue of the fact that
            he began.
